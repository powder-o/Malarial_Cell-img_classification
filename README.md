# Malarial_Cell-img_classification
This is a Deep Learning image classification model which classifies Malarial cells into parasitized and unparasitized cells.
We feed in a dataset of Images with labels: unparasitized(1) and parasitized(0) and train the model to predict a new image as 0 or 1.
We test the Neural Network with different formats and monitor its performance as we play around with things a little bit.

The Neural Network architecture is as follows:
